## Getting started
Now how do you get started? The branch to look out for is a the **phase1**. 

As and when the video is covered in the playlist a corresponding pull request is made to phase1 branch and the code for that particular video is checked in.

For example, lets say I have watched the Video 17 - [Display Product Data - A TimCo Retail Manager Video] on the [TimCo Retail Manager] playlist. You would see a branch with the same number on this Github repo and a corresponding pull request initiated.

> :warning: Note: Please note that the this pattern is not followed for the first few videos. However from video number 14 this has be religiously practised.
